In this homework assignment, you will explore, analyze and model a data set containing 
approximately 2200 records. Each record represents a professional baseball team from the years 1871 
to 2006 inclusive. Each record has the performance of the team for the given year, with all of the 
statistics adjusted to match the performance of a 162 game season.

Your objective is to build a 'multiple linear regression model' on the 'training data' to predict the 
number of wins for the team. You can only use the variables given to you (or variables that you 
derive from the variables provided). Below is a short description of the variables of interest in 
the data set
